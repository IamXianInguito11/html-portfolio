<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Christian Inguito—Engineer by profession, Technician by certification, and a lifelong enthusiast of things that beep, blink, or beg to be upgraded. With a degree in Electronics Engineering from the University of Rizal System (go Rizaleños!) and credentials in both ECE and ECT, I’ve worked everywhere from circuit-choked workbenches to sleek software systems at Accenture. Whether I’m wiring up a paging system or untangling a digital mess, I get my kick from solving problems and pretending I didn’t Google it 10 minutes ago.</p>

<p>My resume reads like a greatest hits album of tech roles: Service Engineer, Technical Engineer, Associate Software Engineer—each one teaching me more about client chaos, troubleshooting wizardry, and the mysterious art of documentation. I've designed auxiliary systems, tested software, and made peace with SAP’s quirks. I'm also the kind of person who self-finances more courses than I have shelf space: from AutoCAD to PCB Design, from basic networking to instrumentation—if it's complex, I'm curious.</p>

<p>But wait, there's more! Outside of engineering, I moonlight as a graphic designer and content creator. You’ll find me crafting NBA-themed flyers in Photoshop, slicing timelines in Premiere Pro, and obsessively adjusting keyframes in After Effects. My Udemy account is practically a digital jungle gym—covering full-stack web development, digital illustration in Illustrator, motion graphics, and more. I guess you could say I’m a creative technologist with a passion for perpetual learning and a tendency to treat tutorials like Netflix.</p>
